# Data Structures Coursework
My solutions/implementations of the data structures and algorithms discussed in class, and relevant assignments. The content is separated into directories for each datastructure, which has files for the structure itself, and driver code for testing.

Each folder contains a makefile, which has recipes to build the driver programs, and a README listing the recipes.
